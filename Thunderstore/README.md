DETAILS:

- 21 second cooldown
- smart targeting! (targets enemy in LOS with highest "combinedhealth" component)
- big recoil
- starts sprinting if it is a small distance away from engi (this is a behaviour the carbonizer has, but the activation distance is super far away, so you probably had no idea)
